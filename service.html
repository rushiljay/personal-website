<p class="service-essay">
    Selfless Service is one of the core values of Aggies across the world. Service means a lot to me, as it is not only a way to give back to the community that has given so much to me, but also to feel good about my place in the world. I define selfless service as creating or working on products or performing services that are beneficial to greater society while considering the welfare of fellow human beings over oneself. For me in particular, serving others brings me a sense of meaning and purpose and understanding of my place in the world, beyond reaping financial rewards for corporations.

    My experience with service started in middle school, where I started the Adopt a Soldier Club. Here, as a club, we worked on events and activities to thank service members of the United States Military, which include veterans, and police officers. We did events such as a Book drive, where we collected over 200 books each year, and also a candy drive with about 200 pounds of Candy, also we did thank you posters for police officers, as well as weekly meetings on the service of soldiers and their sacrifices.

    Consequently, I joined the City of Cupertino Teen Commission as a result of the Adopt a Soldier Club experience, where I served as the appointed Vice-Chair and Chair. This role enabled me to meet with city, county, and state officials regularly, advocating for youth issues, such as civic engagement, underage vaping, and mental health. I helped conduct several hundred-person events, such as a hackathon, civic forum, and online budget planning events. I was the role model for many city commissions and was featured in the City of Cupertino monthly magazine for this effort.

    After coming to Texas A&M University, I plan on using my skills in Computer Science to help create applications that make it easier for students to choose courses and become a better fit for their future careers. Given that the Aggie Core Values are essential in what holds Aggies apart from the rest of the world, I plan to share the message of selfless service with others throughout the world.
