    Areas of Interest
</h2>

<p class="qualifications-description">
I am fascinated by Large Language Models, especially using Transfer Learning to finetune models to become more accurate while using less resources. 
I also want to explore Explainable AI, which is the study of why an AI system makes particular decisions, and I find this imporant as it ensures transparency/fairness in AI, which is increasingly important.
The applications to LLMs to Financal technologies, especially portfolio management, intrigues me, and makes me want to learn more. 
</p>

<p class="qualifications-description">
    I've done some exploring on using LLMs to create applications that can help people. In particular, I've worked on an app that uses the Mistral 7B model to help students choose their majors for ETAM, as well as an application as part of TAMU Hack 2024 to create a LLM that replaces the help button on planes. Most recently, I'm working on an application to help people make AI agents with Mistral AI.

    Most recently, I have worked on certifications in advancing my skills in Natural Language Processing, and fundamentals of Large Language Models, where I was able to learn the mathematical foundations and ways to program, and implement NLP techniques to make custom apps. I was able to complete this through Linkedin Learning.
